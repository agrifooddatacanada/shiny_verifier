The data includes records for both active and culled animals. The culled flag is originally received from HeatTime, but due to data quality issues, it is overridden daily with actual culling events (sold or died) from DairyComp as available in the Once-in-life Events table. Health Alerts records after the actual culling date have been removed to eliminate potential false readings from sensors that may have continued recording after the animal was no longer wearing the collar. Health Index values on the day of culling should be used with caution as they might not be accurate due to potential delays between the actual culling event and when the information was synchronized in the system. These were the filtering parameters from HeatTime: Culled is not <Null or Empty Value> And Health Index for Non Milked Cows <= 86 And Health Index for Non Milked Cows is not <Null or Empty Value> And Application Plan = (Advanced, Premium) And (Maximum Activity over 24 Hours <= 30 Or Maximum Activity over 24 Hours = <Null or Empty Value>) And (Age In Days >= 181 Or Age In Days = <Null or Empty Value>).","name":"sensor_health_scr"}]}},"dependencies":[]},"extensions":{"adc":{"ELckGs4QlNHN9aDXZB1IMbn9woSW3CqP7zQ5HzHtJJ3b":{"d":"EPrNas4WvsAOD0AlY9PUnrNzWp0nkhgiaN2R7b4h9wZp","type":"community/adc/extension/1.0","overlays":{"ordering":{"d":"EAu_UWpSNyFWvOAkxkQLSM2X2w3cyYxPBUpqKVyiNLiU","type":"community/overlays/adc/ordering/1.1","attribute_ordering":["animal_id","allflex_tag","pen","date","time","culled","health_index"],"entry_code_ordering":{}},"unit_framing":{"d":"ENGXn_GebnCtCREEKCDChJdoTvQ4UhQfJYhsznorzeE8","type":"community/overlays/adc/unit_framing/1.1","framing_metadata":{"id":"UCUM","label":"Unified Code for Units of Measure","location":"https://ucum.org/","version":""},"units":{"":{"framing_justification":"semapv:ManualMappingCuration","predicate_id":"skos:exactMatch","term_id":""}}},"sensitive":{"d":"EH03eeS641_CQzycegyrynCne8eRoKyeJoAUD9QlSwnk","type":"community/overlays/adc/sensitive/1.1","sensitive_attributes":[]}}}}}}
