It includes time-stamped records for each animal at hourly or bi-hourly intervals, depending on the sensor type. The data has been synchronized and aligned across sources to produce a complete timeline per animal, even when individual sensor readings are missing. The dataset includes both active and culled animals. The culled flag is derived daily based on confirmed culling events (sold or died) recorded in DairyComp’s Once-in-life Events table, overriding the original HeatTime flag to improve data accuracy. Health Index values follow SCR’s default filtering for health alerts. Records generated after the confirmed culling date are excluded to reduce the risk of including false sensor readings from collars that were still transmitting after removal. Health Index values on the day of culling should be interpreted cautiously due to possible delays between the actual culling and system synchronization. The health_alert field is a binary indicator: it is set to 1 if a Health Index reading is present (i.e., an alert was generated) for a given animal, date, and time, and 0 if no alert was recorded (i.e., health_index is null).","name":"sensor_aggregation_scr"}]}},"dependencies":[]},"extensions":{"adc":{"EI12w4Stuzydp9P9UzHPcWcqOJEve49YW2_AnAoiQhW-":{"d":"EDUnngT1WhXHry-Tas6DNdN0tG5tKZPE5Lmh-vKZdadD","type":"community/adc/extension/1.0","overlays":{"ordering":{"d":"EFcodkxOybdWeFM3SFB22PyScnV8AN0k2EK72mrm-1n7","type":"community/overlays/adc/ordering/1.1","attribute_ordering":["animal_id","allflex_tag","pen","date","time","raw_rumination","raw_activity","health_index","daily_rumination","daily_activity","daily_health_index","health_alert","culled"],"entry_code_ordering":{}},"unit_framing":{"d":"EI3i11fxbxcyOHM0Z1X9sN7fpaK3kJgR7Ktbr-b-9rMZ","type":"community/overlays/adc/unit_framing/1.1","framing_metadata":{"id":"UCUM","label":"Unified Code for Units of Measure","location":"https://ucum.org/","version":""},"units":{"":{"framing_justification":"semapv:ManualMappingCuration","predicate_id":"skos:exactMatch","term_id":""},"undefined":{"framing_justification":"semapv:ManualMappingCuration","predicate_id":"skos:exactMatch","term_id":""}}},"sensitive":{"d":"EH03eeS641_CQzycegyrynCne8eRoKyeJoAUD9QlSwnk","type":"community/overlays/adc/sensitive/1.1","sensitive_attributes":[]}}}}}}
